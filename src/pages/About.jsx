          <span>Our Story</span>
          <h2>Started in 2023 with a simple mission.</h2>
          <p>
            OVTech Academy began in 2023 from a passion for teaching, mentoring,
            and helping people access practical technology education.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many learners have the desire to grow, but they often lack a clear
            roadmap, proper guidance, and real projects that prepare them for
            today’s digital economy. OVTech was created to bridge that gap.
